
Jonah stole NGN500 from Musa's shop. 30minutes later 
he went back to Musa's shop with the same NGN500 and 
bought snacks NGN150, soft drinks NGN120.
Musa gave him a balance of NGN230. 

("How much did Musa lost in total?", ["NGN770","NGN500","NGN730","NGN1000"], "NGN500", Musa lost a total of N500")

Akpos after eating gave NGN1000 to Mama-edo Bukka and requested for his balance. 
Mama-edo bukka did not have NGN700 balance to give Akpos so she collected from her neighbor Madam k.
5minutes after Akpos have left with the balance of NGN700. Madam k returned the NGN1000 to Mama-edo bukka 
because the NGN1000 is counterfeit. Mama-edo bukka after confirming that the money is bad, 
gave Madam k another NGN1000 from her pulse and destroyed the NGN1000 from Akpos.

("How much did Mama-edo bukka lost in total?", ["NGN2700", "NGN1700","NGN1000","NGN2000"], "NGN1000", "What Mama-edo bukka lost is NGN1000. Think of it this way, assuming that Akpos didn't come with money(counterfiet is not considered as a valid money), Mama-edo bukka borrowed NGN700 from Madam k to give Akpos. NGN700 + NGN300 (cost for the food) = NGN1000,")
